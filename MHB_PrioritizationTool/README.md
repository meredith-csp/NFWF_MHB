MISSOURI HEADWATERS BASIN CROSS-REALM MANAGEMENT PRIORITIZATION TOOL


---System Requirements---

 - Windows operating system
 - R (version 3.0.1 or later)
 - RStudio (version 1.0 or later)

This tool is powered by the R statistical programming environment (https://www.r-project.org/). Although there is no need for users to have any familiarity with R, users do need to download and install R and version 1.0 or later of the RStudio software. Unfortunately, because the Zonation software is not compatible with Mac operating systems, this tool can only be run on Windows machines. 

You can download and install the current versions of R and RStudio for Windows here:
https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/R-3.5.0-win.exe
https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.423.exe


---Getting Started---

This tool is designed to help identify priority subwatersheds in the Missouri Headwaters Basin where there is potential for a conservation action of interest to provide the greatest net benefits to multiple conservation targets.

If this is the first time you are running the tool, start by opening the 'MHB_ToolSetup.R' file. RStudio will open a short install script - DON'T PANIC! All you need to do is click the 'Source' button on the right side of the tab header. This will install the R packages needed to run the tool. This should take 5-10 minutes, and you will only need to do this the first time you run the tool. 

To run the tool, open the 'MHB_PrioritizationTool.Rmd' R Markdown file. RStudio will open a script to run the tool - DON'T PANIC! There is no need to understand or interact with the code, simply click 'Run Document' next to the green arrow in the tab header. A graphical user interface will open to allow selection of settings and exploration of the map data. 

Start by selecting your conservation action of interest, then assign weights to conservation targets that are linked to that action, based on their relative importance to you. When the prioritization process is finished, you can use the interactive map and plots to explore the results.

---Credits---

This custom decision support tool was developed by The Center for Large Landscape Conservation (http://www.largelandscapes.org) and Conservation Science Partners (http://www.csp-inc.org), with funding from The National Fish & Wildlife Foundation (http://www.nfwf.org). 

The prioritization is run using Zonation 4.0 (https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/metapopulation-research-centre/software#section-14300) produced by Atte Moilanen and colleagues, and an adaptation of the zonator package for R (https://github.com/cbig/zonator) developed by Joona Lehtomaki.
